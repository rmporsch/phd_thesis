\subsection{Power Comparisons}
\label{sub:power_comparisons}

Figure~\ref{fig:simulatedGeneRealData} displays the mean empirical power for each test under various scenarios for the 50 randomly selected genes.
In each scenario I considered a single causal region of size $\gamma$.
The size of the causal region was defined relative to the total gene size (given in percentage).
For example, given a gene with 10 rare variants and $\gamma=0.2$ then the first $2$ mutations defined as causal mutations.
Empirical power was compared between Skat, SkatO, KS, CMC, Burden and KS-Burden under different assumed effect sizes ($r^2=(0.002, 0.006, 0.009)$).
The selected $50$ genes had at least $6$ genetic variants and maximal $60$ with a median of $8.5$ variants.

All tests were affected by the size of the causal cluster.
As expected, KS and Skat greatly lose statistical power when $\gamma$ increases.
The KS test showed greater statistical power between $\gamma=0.2$ and $\gamma=0.6$ than Skat, but lost significant power when $\gamma$ increases.
Further, KS performed only slightly better than Skat at $\gamma=0.2$.
Interestingly the simple KS test also outperformed SkatO at $\gamma=0.4$, but to a lesser extend.
Both burden tests, that is CMC and Burden, demonstrated an monotonic increase in statistical power over $\gamma$.
Thus suffering from a reduction in power at $\gamma=0.2$ but outperformed all other tests when all variants were disease causing.

Omnibus tests, that is SkatO and KS-Burden, are relatively unaffected by the change in $\gamma$ and KS-Burden is able to outperform SkatO across scenarios.
However, while the mean power of SkatO remains rather stable across all scenarios, KS-Burden has a slight reduction in power at $\gamma=0.2$.

Assessment of the correlation between test statistics of KS and Burden test across assessed genes under the null was with $r=0.03$ small.
Thus providing some evidence for the indecency of both tests. %TODO need to check this correlation again
