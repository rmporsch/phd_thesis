\subsection{Power Comparisons}
\label{sub:power_comparisons}

Figure~\ref{fig:simulatedGeneRealData} displays the mean empirical power for each test under various scenarios for the 50 randomly-selected genes.
In each scenario I considered a single causal region of size $\gamma$.
The size of the causal region was defined relative to the total gene size (given in percentage).
For example, given a gene with 10 rare variants and $\gamma=0.2$ then the first $2$ mutations were defined as causal mutations.
Empirical power was compared between SKAT, SKAT-O, KS, CMC, Burden, and KS-Burden under different assumed effect sizes ($r^2=(0.002, 0.006, 0.009)$).
The selected $50$ genes had at least $6$ genetic variants and a maximum of $60$ with a median of $8.5$ variants.

All tests were affected by the size of the causal cluster.
As expected, KS and SKAT greatly lose statistical power when $\gamma$ increases.
The KS test showed greater statistical power between $\gamma=0.2$ and $\gamma=0.6$ than SKAT, but lost significant power when $\gamma$ increased.
Further, KS performed only slightly better than SKAT at $\gamma=0.2$.
Interestingly, the simple KS test also outperformed SKAT-O at $\gamma=0.4$, but to a lesser extent.
Both burden tests, CMC and Burden, demonstrated a monotonic increase in statistical power over $\gamma$,
 suffering from a reduction in power at $\gamma=0.2$ but outperforming all other tests when all variants were disease-causing.

Omnibus tests, that is SKAT-O and KS-Burden, are relatively unaffected by the change in $\gamma$ and KS-Burden is able to outperform SKAT-O across scenarios.
However, while the mean power of SKAT-O remains rather stable across all scenarios, KS-Burden has a slight reduction in power at $\gamma=0.2$.

Assessment of the correlation between KS and Burden test statistics across assessed genes was small ($r=0.03$).
Thus providing some evidence for the independence of both tests. %TODO need to check this correlation again

\subsection{Rare Variant Analysis of the UK Biobank}
\label{sub:ukbiobank_aggression}

I applied the KS-Burden test on the UK Biobank in order to identify genes enriched for, as well as distributional differences in, rare mutations. 
The KS-Burden test was unable to identify any genes significantly associated with impulsive aggression (see Table~\ref{tab:top_ksburden}).
Inspection of the QQ-plot (see Figure~\ref{fig:qqplot_ksburden}) further suggests the absence of any signal within the tested phenotype.
