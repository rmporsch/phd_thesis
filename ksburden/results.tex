\subsection{Power Comparisons}
\label{sub:power_comparisons}

Figure~\ref{fig:simulatedGeneRealData} displays the mean empirical power for each test under various scenarios for the 50 randomly selected genes.
In each scenario I considered a single causal region of size $\gamma$.
The size of the causal region was defined relative to the total gene size.
For example, given a gene with 10 rare variants and $\gamma=0.2$ then the first $2$ mutations defined as causal mutations.
Empirical power was compared between Skat, SkatO, KS, Burden (CMC, Burden) and KS-Burden under different assumed effect sizes ($r^2=(0.002, 0.006, 0.009)$).
The selected $50$ genes had at least $6$ genetic variants and maximal $60$ with a  median of $8.5$.

First of all, all tests are affected by the size of the causal cluster.
As expected, KS and Skat greatly lose statistical power when $\gamma$ increases.
The KS test showed greater statistical power between $\gamma=0.4$ and $\gamma=0.6$ than Skat.
Further, the simple KS test performed slightly better than SkatO at $\gamma=0.4$.
Both burden tests (CMC and Burden) show an monotonic increase in statistical power given an increase in $\gamma$.
In addition, omnibus tests, that is SkatO and KS-Burden, are relatively unaffected by a change in $\gamma$.
Thus reflecting estimated statistical power of the KS test.

Overall, KS-Burden is able to outperform SkatO across all but one simulation scenario.
In scenarios in which all variants are disease causing both burden tests outperform all remaining tests.
Further, CMC and Burden seem to be equivalent in most circumstances.

\end{figure}

In addition, assessment of the correlation between test statistics of KS and Burden test across assessed genes under the null was with $r=0.03$ small.
Thus providing some evidence for the indecency of both tests. %TODO need to check this correlation again 

\subsection{UKBioBank -- Aggression}

The QQ-plot for all tests is displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:qqplot_ksburden} and the top $10$ genes are shown in Table~\ref{tab:top_ksburden}.
