Foremost, the genetic correlations betwee impulsive aggression and depressive symptomes is remarkably high ($r_g=0.6741$, $SE=0.0919$, $p=2.2326e-13$).
This high correlation is also reflected in a subjects diagnosed with a major depression ($r_g=0.4134$, $SE=0.1212$, $p=6e-04$).
In contrast, correlations between impulsive aggression and Bipolar disorder did not reached significant levels ($r_g=0.1192$, $SE=0.0949$, $p=0.2091$), and genetic correlations with Schizophrenia, while significant, was not of large effect ($r_g=0.161$, $SE=0.0566$, $p=0.0045$).
