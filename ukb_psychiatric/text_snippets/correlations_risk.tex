In contrast to impulsive aggression, correlations between risk taking and Bipolar ($r_g=0.2561$, $SE=0.0606$, $p=2.4034e-05$), as well as Schizophrenia ($r_g=0.232$, $SE=0.0431$, $p=7.3554e-08$) remain significant after adjusting for multiple testing.
In addition, while genetic correlations were highly significant between aggression and depression, genetic correlations between risk raking, depressive symptomes ($r_g=0.0856$, $SE=0.0687$, $p=0.2129$) as well as MDD ($r_g=0.0028$, $SE=0.0853$, $p=0.974$) were small and did not pass the multiple testing thershold.
