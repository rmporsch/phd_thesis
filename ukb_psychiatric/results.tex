\subsection{Mendelian Randomization}
\label{sub:mendelian_randomization}

Applied MR-method suggest some indication for a causal effect on depressive symptomes on impulsive aggression (Figure~\ref{fig:overall_mr_effect}).
Noticable, all but one method indicate significant causal influence on aggression. 
Specifically, MR Egger, which represents a more conservative approch, shows not only non-significance but also displays a different direction of effect.
A possible explanation for this discrepency can be found in potential pleiotropic effects which might violate MR assumptions.
Inspection of the corresponding funnel plot (see Figure~\ref{fig:sensitivity}) suggest the some pleiotropic effects between selected SNPs and impulsive aggression.
However, other, more liberal method, do indicate a clear causal connection between depresssive symptomes and impulsive aggression.
This connection is further supported by an analysis of the MR of Major depressive disorder and aggression.
Corresponding to depressive symptomes, this analysis suggests that this sever metal disorder might cause an increase in aggressive behavior. 
In contrast, MR indicates no significant effect but demonstrats unity in regards to the direction of the effect across all used methods.
Inspection of the funnel plot further suggests neglectable pleiotropic effects which might violate the assumption.

\end{figure}

Further, there is some indication that SZ might cause an increase in aggressive behavior.
Similar to the analyses described above, all but MR-egger suggest a significant effect. 
However, in contrast to the previous described analysis there is very little evidence to support a violation of the underlying MR assumptions.
Thus making a causal connection between these two phenotypse more plausible.

In addition, to aggression MR in connection to risk taking only yield one potential causal relationship.
All used method, with the exception of MR-egger, suggest that Schizophrenia causes an increase in risk taking behavior.
Inspection of both funnel plots and intercept of the MR-egger regression coeffcient indicate no major violation of assumptions.
