    (A) Genetic correlations between impulsive aggrsesion and psychiatric disorders. 
    (B) Genetic correlations between risk taking and psychiatric disorders.
    The error bars display the 95\% confidence intervals for each pairwise genetic correlations.
    Significance levels after multiple testing correction are displayed in form of a dot ($p\ge 0.05$) and triangle ($p\leq0.05$).

\subsection{Mendelian Randomization}
\label{sub:mendelian_randomization}

Applied MR-method suggest some indication for a causal effect on depressive symptomes as well as MD on impulsive aggression (Figure~\ref{fig:overall_mr_effect}).

    The effect size of the causal effect $\beta$ is displayed on the y-axis, while used Mendelian randomization methods are on the x-axis.
