I would like to thank my supervisors Stacey S. Cherny, Pak C. Sham as well as Mercedes Garcia-Barcelo for their support and encouragement throughout this PhD\@.
I also would like to thank all members associated with the Sham Lab, especially Timothy Mak with whom I always had fascinating discussions about statistical topics.

Furthermore, I would like to thank all participants of my studies.
Without their selfless dedication to science by providing not only their genetic material but also by spending their valuable time answering numerous questionnaires these studies would not have been possible.

Also big thanks to Meike Bartels and Dorret Boomsma for thank their support during my time in Amsterdam.
In addition, I would like to thank the IT team of the Center of Genomic Science for their advice on how to run my computations more efficiently.  

At last I would like to thank the Hong Kong Government for providing me with financial support during my time as a PhD student.
