\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:introduction}

% Dramatic entry
World War I and II, the Holocaust, as well as more recent terror attacks have demonstrated the extend of which human aggression is capable of causing distruction and harm to an extend previously unknown. 
Thus aggressive behavior remains a continous issue in all human societies and significant reseach effort has been spend to identify causes of human aggression.
This ranges from gun control, global warning, computer games and movies, as well as others to more biological and evolutionary causes. %TODO needs some citation for each
Here I will present major genetic characteristics of aggressive behavior in children and adults.
Ranging from studies on twins to large scale genome wide association studies.

% Intro to the intro
However, first I will present current and past research on aggressive behavior.
Within this literature review I will first present different subtypes of aggresssion.
Following I will describe commonly associated enviormental factors contributing to aggressive behavior.
This is succeeded by an introduction into the evolutionary theories of aggression.
I will then describe to which extend genetic factors influence aggressive behavior followed by a sumamry of recent discoveries in molecular genetics.
I will conclude this section by a short describtion of the here presented studies.

\section{Definition of Aggression}
\label{sec:overview_of_reseach_in_aggression}

One can define human aggression as a behavior intended to cause physical or emotional harm to others \cite{Anderson2002}.
However, it is important to not only consider the motivation of the predator but also the unwilling participation of the victim.
Thus to also include behaviors in which the target does not intend to avoid the aggressive behavior, such as in sexual masochism one needs to extend the simple definition by the believe of the predator that the target wants to avoid the behavior (e.i. to avoid being harmed) \cite{Berkowitz1993,Baumeister1989,Baron2007,Geen2001} as well as the motivation of the victim to avoid such harm.  
Therefore I will use the following working definition:
\begin{mydef}[Aggression]
	\label{def:aggression}
	"Aggression is the delivery of an aversive stimulus form one person to another, with itent to harm and with an expectations of causing such harm, when the other person is motivated to escape or avoid the stimulus" \cite{Geen2001}
\end{mydef}

This basic definition does not cover all possible situations and involved factors.
For example it does not account for emotions or complex cognitive processes preceeding aggressive behavior.
However, it does provide a basic necessary working definition for aggressive behavior in adults and children.  
While aggression is most commonly associated with physical harm, definition~\ref{def:aggression} also includes a more broader spectrum.
This includes spreading gossips, damaging a victims property either due to emotional anger or as a planned action to gain an advantage to a higher goal.
The possible spectrum of aggression makes it necessary to specify some more broader dimension of this behavior.

\subsection{Forms of aggression}
\label{sub:forms_of_aggression}

One con futher aggressive behavior into \textit{affective Aggression} and \textit{instrumental Aggresssion}.
While the former is characerised as emotional, impulsive, thoughtless and unplanned behavior, \textit{Instrumental Aggression} is defined as a planed and proactive behavior to obtain a certain higher goal \cite{Berkowitz1993,Geen2001}.
The distinction between certain types of aggression has been extended by a number of similar concepts, such as \textit{reactive/proactive} and \textit{offensive/defensive} aggression.
While these terms have slightly different meaning, depending on situtation and field of research the general concept remains the same \cite{Geen2001, Blanchard2005b}.
In psychology, for example, the term \textit{affective Aggression} and \textit{instrumental Aggresssion} has been establised, but more recently authors have used the terms \textit{reactive} and \textit{proactive} aggression \cite{Geen2001}.
Thus aggressive action in response to a provocation, such as self-defence and in anger, is \textit{reactive aggression} while planned, un-provoced aggression is called \textit{provocative}.

However, despite the differences in terminology it is important to emphasise the strong negative emotional state of \textit{affective/reactive} aggression.
This state, often descibed as \textit{anger}, launches and guids affective aggression  and is often caused by some form of provocation\cite{Geen2001}.
However, \cite{Frijda1994} suggested that \textit{affective/reactive aggression} is not necessary impulsive.
In some situations a delayed response between provocation and aggressive response is observed. 
In particular long term grudges, or \textit{hatreds} are preoccupations which go beyond the initial provocation but remain deeply emotional.
Thus I will use the term \textit{impulsive aggression} to refer to impulsive, emotional guided aggressive behavior.

In contrast \textit{Instrumental/proactive aggression} is characerised by the absence of an emotional strong cause to cause harm.
For example, the use of gossip and bad-mouthing of a colleague in order to obtain higher chances of receiving a promotion is done in a planned manner with the aim of a higher goal (receiving the promotion).
However, it is often difficult to distiguish actions into affective and instrumental aggression since both forms are not mutually exclusive.
\citet{Geen2001} gave the example of a mother who uses corporal punishment to modify her child's behavior, while still reacting in anger when observing the undesired child's behavior.

Both forms of aggression, affective and instrumental, can be either physical or verbal.
While physical aggression in humans is homologous to other animals, verbal aggression, also called indirect, relational and social aggression, is relativly distinct to humans \cite{Archer2005}.
These verbal behaviors cause harm to others by gossiping, spreading rumors, or excluding other from social groups.
While the terms \textit{indirect}, \textit{relational}, and \textit{social} aggression have been differently conceptulized in the past \cite{Archer2001}, they are expressed in common behaviors, can be contrasted to physical aggression to a similar extend as well as have been shown to demonstrate the similar differences between the two sexes \cite{Archer2004}.
Hence the terms are more similar than distinct and I will therefore proceed to call all them \textit{indirect} aggression in order to distiguish it more from the physical, more direct aggressive behavior\cite{Archer2005}.

Studies investigating aggression in animals have often distiguished between \textit{offensive} and \textit{deffensive} aggression \cite{Blanchard2005b}.
Similar to \textit{affective} aggression \textit{offensive} attacks arise from a response to a threat to the animals resources, thus are the response to a certain provocation.
These resources could be sexual partners, food, social status, or in the case of humans, also money.
On the other hand \textit{deffensive} aggression is the result to a direct threat to the subject life, a concept closer related to \textit{instrumental} aggression.
While this distingen might hold in mice and rats, the seperation between \textit{offensive} and \textit{deffensive} aggression is more blured in primates, including humans.
For example, humans are known to hunt lions and other predators.
In contrast to non-predators, these animals are, for the most part, not eaten which would suggest a form of deffensive aggressive behavior.
However, within most human cultures killing a large predator is seen to enlarge ones social status by showing strenght and courage towards the others.
A behavior which could be described as an \textit{offensive} action.
Thus the distinction between \textit{offensive} and \textit{deffensive} aggression is blured.
This blured distinction reflects the above described example of the punishing mother by \cite{Geen2001}.
However, \cite{Blanchard2005b} suggest, while the distinction between \textit{offensice/affective} a and \textit{defensive/instrumental} might be blured in humans, the distiction holds in general.
The authors suggested that rather insufficient analysis and not a disconnetion between animal and human behavior are responsible for the blured distiction within humans.
%TODO this is quite weak

\section{Evolutionary Theories}
\label{sec:evolutionary_theories}

Historically, research of aggression has been devided into nurture versus nature \cite{Archer2009}. 
Proponents of the nurture side have argued that aggressive behavior is caused by enviormental influences, while supports of the nature side of the discussion supported the idea that only differences in the genetic architecture are able to explain individual differences in aggressive behavior.
Today's view is less polarized and acknowledghes that both, nature and nurture play a crucial part in aggression.
While not disregarding the enviormental aspect of aggression completly I will mostly focus on the genetic and biological causes of aggressive behavior.
In the following section I will outline evolutionary concepts helpful in explaining individual differences of aggression. 

There is a long eveolutionary history of human aggressive behavior. 
For example paleontological findings of broken bones, rips and smashed skulls, unexplainable without the consideration of weaponary force, and occasional findings of weapon fragments in skeletal rib cages suggest that violence and aggression has been part of the human evolutionary history. 
\citet{Buss1997}, one of the founder of evolutionary psychology, suggested that all psychological mechanisms and behavior, including aggression, originate in the evolutionary priciple of selection.  
These mechanisms are aimed to solve specific adaptive problems.
Hence some variants of those behaviors and psycholigcal mechanisms might solve certain problems better than others, improving overall fitness.
This results in the preservation, replication and spreading of theses varaints throught a population \cite{Buss1997}.
Hence, from a evolutionary perspective, every human behavior can be seen as a solution to a specific adaptive problem.
Therefore aggression is, from an evolutionary view, an adaptive problem solving mechanism.

\citet{Buss1997} suggested \textit{seven} adaptive problems to which aggressive behavior might be an evolutionary solution.
For example \textit{Co-Opt the Resources of Others}, which can be defined as the use of physical or psycholigcal force to obtain resources hold by another indivudual or group, can give the aggressors significant advantages in terms of survival and reproduction.
These resources could mean food, water, land or secual partners.
An example of this can be seen in aggressive behavior of children.
\citet{Campbell1995} noted that aggression among toddlers is often about resouces, such as toys, suggesting that this behavioral adaptations is an old evelutionary strategy.

As discussed above, aggression can also be useful in \textit{defending against an attack}.
Since attacking aggressors are a serious threat to valuable resources.
Aggression can be an effective strategy in defending against indivuduals or groups.
Further, it can be also an adaptive strategy to foster a reputation that would deter potential aggressors \cite{Buss1997}.
Thus avoiding the potential cost of a physical conflict while defending one's resources.

Another evolutionary benefit of aggression can be found in the social hierarchies in groups.
For example, men who win fights and defeat opponents gain power and status in many societies \cite{Hill1996}.
The gain in social status can be beneficial in accessing resources and mates \cite{Archer2009}.
Indeed, hirarical order in social groups is often established by means of aggressive behavior which enables high ranked individuals prioriy access to food and mating paterns\cite{Lindenfors2011}. 
However, aggression can also result in an decline in status.
\citet{Buss1997} suggested for example that a physical conflict between two professors in a facutly meeting would result in an decline in repuatation.
Thus display of aggression is not acceptable in all social situations.

Further aggressive behavior plays a crucial part in mating.
In the context of reproduction one should consider aggrssion towards the same-sex seperate of male-female aggression.
Aggression towards same-sex individuals is sometimes aimed to reduce their social status and therefore make them less attractive to the other sex \cite{Buss1990}.
Hence inflicting damage on a rival directly translates to an incresed benefit to the aggresssor.
In addition to aggression towards same-sex individuals, aggression is also prevelant towards the oposite sex.
For example, aggression can be used to deter a long-term mate from infidelity \cite{Daly1982}.
However, also here aggression can have negative consequences in form of retahilation.
For example, a husband might be reluctant to use aggression towards his wive when she is living close to a number of brothers and a powerful father.
Indeed, a study in Madrid, Spain found that women who had a higher density of genetic kin in and around Madrid were less likely to be victim of domestic violence \cite{Figueredo1995}.
Hence aggression only brings an evolutionary advantage when the benefits outweight the potential costs.

Same-sex and male-female aggression is not equally balanced among the two sexes and nearly all mammals display sex differences in the expression of aggression.
Qualitative, the type of aggression, as well as quantitative.
In general males are more likely to exhibit physical aggression than female.
These sex differences have been discussed in the context of sexual selection theory (SST) \cite{Archer2004,Anderson2002}. 
Sexual selection is concerned how a member of one sex choses another individual from the other sex, as well as the competion between members of the sex over access to the other \cite{Darwin1859}.
In most mammals the more competitive sex is the male \cite{Archer2009}. 
\citet{Trivers1972} suggested that these sex differences can be explained by the commonly observed reduced parental investment by males.
Parental investment is the amount of resources a parent investes into his or her off spring to increase its survivial and reproduction \cite{Archer2009}.
The theory was first suggested by \citet{0198504403} and proses that a male can minimize his parental investment in favor in producing a higher amount of offspring.
In contrast, many female mammals have an large obligatory patrenatal investment, such as gestation and delivery.
Thus female partner selection is more careful compared to male.
Hence the female selection of good reproductive fitness is directly linked to offset the lack of male paternal investment.
Since aggression is, as described above, often associated with an increased access to sexual partners one can conclude that this behavior is under sexual selection.

Despite these advatages, increased levels of aggressive behavior can also be harmful to the individual.
Expressing aggression towards another individual sheers energy away from other acitivies, such as hunting and foraging, and also carries a high risk of injury and death \cite{Packer1995}.  
This increased cost is also reflected in the conflict resolving method applied across many animals and human.
For example two competing male red deer may begin their confrontation by roaring repeatedly.
If this does not resolve the conflict both will walk side-by-side while attempting to make themself look as large as possible.
Only the last stage involes a physical confrontation, potentially causing sever injuries \cite{Clutton-Brock1979a}.
These behaviors, aimed to resolve conflicts without the use of raw force, demonstrates the large costs of physical aggresssion.
However, it does also show that animals and humans alike are able to avoid those costs by threating the use of physical force.
\citet{Maxson2005} suggested that if the fighting ability of the resource holding power (RHP) as well the resource value (RV) are the same for both contestant, conflicts will usually escalate.
Another, 
Despinte the advantages of using aggression to gain a higher social status there are considerable negative consequences.
In a study \cite{Packer1995} on 138 female baboons in the Gombe National Park in Tanzania high-ranking females showed lower inter-birth intercals as well as higher offspring survival rates.
Thsu one would expect higher life-time reproductive success in baboons with overall higher social rank acorss their life-time.
However, the authors were not able to associate reproductive success with mean life-time rank.
\citet{Packer1995} suggested that this inconsitency can be explained by considering that higher ranked females are also more likely to suffer a  miscarriages.
These stress-related failure in reproduction can be seen as a counter-force to a potential arms-race among female baboons.
Hence the induced aggression by competing for higher social status carries the cost of significant risk of misscarigas.

Therefore, the increase in fitness due to aggressive behavior, either as a direct gain in resources or higher social status, is balanced by large risks such as injuries, death, reduced reproduction and others.
This would indicate that aggression is under stabilizing selection (see figure~\ref{fig:stab}).

\end{figure}


The above outlined cross-species and evolutionary history of aggressive behavior suggests thats inherited biological factors play a key role.
In the following secton I will outline specific genetic aspects of aggression.
Due to the widespread use of aggressive behavior and the limits of genetic research in humans, genetic studies have mostly focused on nonhuman animals.
Further I will describe potential nerological mechanisms involved in aggression among mamals, as well as the role of hormones.
At last I will focus on studies on human, both in twins and adoption studies as well as genome wide association studies.


\section{Biological Mechanisms}
\label{sec:biological_mechanisms}

\subsection{The involvement of neurotransmitters in aggression}
\label{sub:the_involvement_of_neurotransmitters_in_aggression}

A number of neurotransmitters have been investigated in their involvement into aggressive behavior.
This includes mainly serotonin and monamines.
Within this section I will briefly discuss findings relating these two neurotransmitters to aggression.


\subsection{The Genetics of Aggression}
\label{sub:the_genetics_of_aggression}

Comparative genetics is the use and analysis of genomic information across species to identify and relate genes with phenotypes \cite{Maxson2003}.
The comaprison across species to identify genes which are related to aggresssion has a number of advantages.
As outlined in section~\ref{sec:evolutionary_theories}, aggressive behavior is present in number of species which indicates that this particular bahvior is, form an evolutionary view, relativly old.
Thus a cross species perspectives enables to examine to those few genes present acorss species.
This not only allows to identify genes involved in aggression across species but also enables to consider neural mechanisms and gene-enviornment interactions similar in humans and non-humans alike.
\citet{Maxson2005} described three general approaches to investigate the genetic architecture of aggressive behavior.
(1) One can identify genes by mapping their sequence to different forms of aggression (see my own study in chapter ???).
(2) Another approach is to alter the genetic code of experimental organisms, such as rats and mice, to test for the effects of different genes on aggression.
(3) Last, one can measure the rate of gene expression within the brain in association with an aggressive phenotype.
Research in humans is only possible recently possible via 1 and 2, but is associated with significant cost.
Option 2 has the highest scientific vadility due to the use of randomized control trials, a method only available in nonhuman animals due to ethical considerations.
However, one can also add a fourth category.
One can also investige DNA methylation in order to investigate the epigenetic mechanisms of aggressive behavior.
DNA methylation is used as a biological control mechanisms by the organism to control gene expression.
While studies on DNA methylation in human aggression have been only recently been conducted \cite{VanDongen2015a} this new field of study is potentially promssing in investigating the genetic mechanisms of aggression.
