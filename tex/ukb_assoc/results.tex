\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

The result section of this chapter is structured into two separate parts.
First I will present the result of the GWAS on impulsive aggression.
This is followed up by the presentation of the GWAS result on risk taking.
At last I will look at genetic correlations between phenotypes as well as PRS and heritability estiamtions for each of the phenotypes.

\subsection{Impulsive Aggression}
\label{sub:impulsive_aggression_gwas}

No significant hits were identified in $\sim37,320$ subjects (see Figure~\ref{fig:gwas_impAgg}).
This is unfortunate but not surprising giving the low number of individuals.
Further no population stratification has been identified (Table~\ref{tab:LDscImpAgg}) and SNP heritability is relatively low.

\end{table}

\subsection{Risk Taking}
\label{sub:risk_taking_gwas}

In contrast to impulsive aggression, risk taking has a considerable sample size.
In total there were $120,286$ subjects available with a complete phenotype.
The corresponding QQ and Manhattan plot are displayed in figure~\ref{fig:risktaking_gwas}, and the lead SNPs are shown in table~\ref{tab:lead_snps_risk}.
As mentioned above, lead SNPs were identified using clumping.
LD-score regression indicates no major population stratification since both intercept and ratio approaches $0$ (see table~\ref{tab:ldscrisk}).

The Manhattan plot in figure~\ref{fig:riskmanhatten} shows two clear signal in chromosome 3 and 6, as well as a signal which is just below genome wide significant at chromosome 4.
A closer inspection of the signal in chromosome 3 shows 2 lead SNPs (see table~\ref{tab:lead_snps_risk}).
However, \textit{rs1308431} and \textit{rs7639518} have opposite directions of effect.
In order to investigate if the signals are independent of each other I performed a conditional analysis.
Using the top SNP (\textit{rs13084531}) as a covariate, the analysis showed no independent genome-wide significant effect.
Thus suggesting that \textit{rs7639518} is not independent of \textit{rs13084531}.
However, a closer look at the conditional regression model suggest that the \textit{rs7639518} might be a potentially independent signal (see table~\ref{tab:conditional}) since the resulting p-value is relatively low.

Below I will describe the three identified regions of interest (the two genome wide significant signals as well as the one approaching significance).
I also performed a quick literature review as well as looked up the three SNPs in the GWAS catalog (see table~\ref{tab:gwas_risk_catalog})

\paragraph{rs9379971}
\label{par:rs9379971}
This particular variant has the strongest association among all tested SNPs with a p-value of $2.14e-09$. 
The SNP is an intronic variant, without any mentioning in the GWAS catalog~\cite{Welter2014}.
As you can see in the LocusZoom plot (figure~\ref{fig:rs9379971}) the region round the identified SNPs is rather dense. 
The SNPs has been associated with \textit{POM121L2} and the region has been connected with schizophrenia across multiple studies~\cite{Aberg2013,Shi2009}.
However, the function of \textit{POM121L2} is not well understood.

\paragraph{rs13084531}
\label{par:rs13084531}
As you can see in figure~\ref{fig:rs13084531} the variant is in a relatively large LD region with a comparable p-value to the previous SNP ($9.826e-09$).
The SNPs is an intron variant within the gene \textit{CADM2}.
The gene has been associated with BMI~\cite{Speliotes2010} as well as executive functions and processing speed~\cite{Ibrahim-Verbaas2015}.
Interestingly the SNP associated in the study by~\cite{Ibrahim-Verbaas2015} (rs17518584) is in LD to our loci (rs13084531 with $R^2=0.4951;D'=0.9983$).
Hence suggesting a common loci for executive functions and risk taking.
Further the region of this SNP (3p12.1) has been connected to spirometric measures in smokers~\cite{Lutz2015}.

\paragraph{rs4386663}
\label{par:rs4386663}
This SNP is an intergenic variant with no known association with any regulatory functions.
However, the SNP is only marginal significant ($6.059e-08$).
Interestingly, however, the chromosomal region of this SNP (chr4q12) was also associated with spirometric measures in smokers by the same study as in variant rs13084531 (see paragraph~\ref{par:rs13084531}).
The LocusZoom plot (see figure~\ref{fig:rs13084531}) suggests a relatively narrow LD region.
