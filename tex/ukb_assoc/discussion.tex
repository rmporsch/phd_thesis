\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:ukb_assc_discussion}

The aim of this study was to identfy specific genetic markers associated with aggression and risk taking,
as well as estimate the genetic overlap across multiple related phenotyes.
Making use of a large population based sample I was able to identify two genetic loci assocated with risk taking in chromosome three and six.
Conditional FDR analysis suggested a third independent variant in chromosome three.
Neither the GWAS nor cFDR was able to identify genome wide significant signals in impulsive aggression.
Nevertheless, considerable genetic correlations were identified with a multitude of related phenotyes, including smoking, alcohol consumption, and neuroticisim.

Overall this study was able to replicate the results of previous studies on risk taking~\cite{Day2016}, but given the limited available sample size for impulsive aggressive behavior the null findings in this particular phenotye are not surprising.
Interestingly, cFDR analysis suggestes a close genetic relationship between risk taking, alcohol consumption and smoking.
In particular, smoking was able to aid the identifcation of at least one additional SNPs assocated with risk taking.
However, the exact function of this SNPs remains unknown and further functional studies are necessary in order to identify potential biological mechanism associated with this locus.

Nevertheless, as predicted, consinderable genetic correlations were identfied between risk taking and impulsive aggression.
This high genetic overlap supports the suggestion that these two phenotyes are part of a wider sensation seeking personaltiy cluster~\cite{Zuckerman2000} which might have been evolutionary useful in exploring new territories, as well as forgaging for food and mates.

However, contrary to a number of phenotyical studies showing a strong causal link between alcohol consumption and aggressive behavior~\cite{FRANZKOWIAX1987,Zuckerman2000,Dakwar2011} esitmated genetic correlation between the two phenotypes display a negative direction.
Thus suggesting that genetic components increasing aggressive behavior might also reduce alcohol consumption.
Similar, phenotypical correlations between the two traits are rather small.
These results stand in contrast to studies investigating the enviormental connection between aggressive behavior and alcohol consumption~\cite{Bushman1990}.
However, there are multiple possible explanation for this discrepancy.
Formost, previous studies investigating the causal link between alcohol consumption and aggression were randomized control trials and used only small number of participants.
In addition, most participants were College students.
In contrast the here presented investigation made use of a population based sample of mostly older participants.
Thus could potentially explain the differences between previous studies and the here presented phenotyical results.
Nevertheless, it is still important to note that this would affect the genetic correlations between the two traits to a lesser extend.

It is further surprising that the overall genetic correlation between alcohol consumption and risk taking is relativly low.
This stands in contrast to the consinderable infaltion within the conditional QQ plot.
A possible explnation for these discrepancy can be found the application of these two methedolgies.
While cFDR only assesses certain SNPs passing a certain threshold, the genetic correlations takes all SNPs into account, hence accounting for a creater proportion of ploygenicity.
An alternative consideration is that the genetic correlation between risk taking and alcohol consumption is not significant, thus suggesting that the overall estiamted genetic correlation might be random.
However, this arguemnt stand in contrast to the considerable genetic correlations between impulsive aggression and alcohol consumption, while the cFDR for aggressive behavior displays no indication of an inflation.
Here it is important to note that genetic correlations can arise from a multitude of different factors (as described in Section~\ref{sec:heritability_and_genetic_correlation}).
Assessing the whole genome to estimate a pairwise correlation could potentially be more biased by additional third variables than asessing the overall inflation of SNPs selected under some $p-value$ threshold.
Similar a recent study by~\citet{Shi2016a} showed consinderable regional genetic correlations among traits which had neglectable overall correlations.
Thus supporting the arguement that the discrepancy between cFDR and genetic correlations is due to the selection of highly significant SNPs.

In addition to the identfied genetic overlap of alcohol consumption with risk taking and aggressive behavior the involvement of smoking is also of relvance.
In particular, two genome wide significant genetic variants have, next to their assocation with risk taking, also associations with spirometric measurements of smokers.
This potential genetic overlap is supported by both cFDR as well as genetic correlations estimates.
These considerable genetic overlaps are supprising given the very limited phentypical correlations between the smoking and risk taking as well as aggression.
A possible explanation is that smoking behavior is influenced by the ability of an individual to  inhibit temptation.
While this effect might not be strong enough to be observerd in the phenotypic data, it does manifest itself by a gentic ovelap with both risk taking and aggressive behavior.
Two phenotypes which have been liked to a sensation seeking personaltiy cluster~\cite{Zuckerman2000}.
Thus one could hypothesis that risk taking and aggrssive behavior might causally affect smoking status.
Unfortunatly, there is currently no experimental data available which could test this hypothesis.

Similar, analysis of the interrelationship between neuroticism and risk taking as well as aggression suggests some genetic overlap.
Specifically, while the genetic correlations between impulsive aggression and neuroticism is high, the correlations between the personality trait and risk taking is not significant, nor of large effect.
This is very much in line with the phenotypic correlations which suggest relativly high correlations between neuroticism and aggression but nearly no correlation with risk taking.
Further, previous studies have shown that neurotic individuals are less likley to engage in risky behavior~\cite{lauriola2001,instituteofmedicine2011,paulus2003}, while subjects with high level of neuroticism are known to be more likely act aggressivly towards others~\cite{Meesters2007}.
There here presented genetic evidence support this phentypical connection and further suggest that neuroticism and aggressive behavior share subtial degree of genetic factors.

Despite the here presented strong evidence for genetic overlap between risk taking, agression, alcohol consuption, smoking and neuroticism there a few limitations.
Formost, I was unable to detect a genome wide significant signal in impulsive aggression.
This can be explained by the limited sample size which potetially also affect the anslysis of the cFDR\@.
However, the sample size is sufficient to compute genetic correlations across all analysed phenotypes.

While the instrument used to measure both neuroticism, alcohol consumption, risk taking and smoking status have been used in the past, the usage of single item questionaires to assess aggression is not common.
However, as shown in Chapter~\ref{chap:longHera}, distribution of aggression scores often approach an L-like distribution and can often be dichotomised into either aggressive or not aggressive individuals.
Thus suggesting that the use of a single item to measure aggressive behavior is justified.

\subsection{Conclusion}
\label{sub:conclusion}

This study was able to replicated previous genome wide significant signals in risk taking.
Further, usage of conditional FDR was able to identify an additonal locus associated with risk taking.
In addition, I showed considerable genetic overlap between risk taking and aggressive behavior, as well as with other traits.
In particular, between aggression and neuroticism as well as between smoking and risk taking.
Thus suggesting that these traits might be influenced by common genetic factors.
However, the exact causal connection between these traits remains unknown and further studies, possiblly with the use of Medelian randomizations, might be necessary to further understand the interrelationships between these complex human behaviors.
