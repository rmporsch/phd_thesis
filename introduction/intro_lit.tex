\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:introduction}

% dramatic entry
Aggressive behavior has potential beneficial and harmful consequences for the aggressor.
While aggression caries a serious risk of bodily harm for the aggressor, it also has the potential to increase access to resources and higher social status.
The nature and cause of such behavior has always been of interest to social and biological focused researchers and much scientific effort has been spend to investigate the various different facets of this complex behavior.
While previous research has been focused on environmental as well as biological causes of aggressive behavior, here I will solely focus on potential biological mechanisms of human aggression.
Specifically I will investigate potential genetic causes of human aggressive behavior via a variety of different statistical methods.

The first chapter of this thesis will review the existing literature in regards to the definition and forms of aggression, as well as evolutionary theories and known genetic risk factors associated with this complex behavior.
Subsequently, I will give an overview of the statistical methods used within this thesis.
Chapter 3 describes my investigation of over 28,000 twin pairs to examine the longitudinal heritability of childhood aggression.
The next chapter describes the exploration of specific molecular genetic marker associated with risk taking and aggression in over 150,000 unrelated individuals.
Afterwards, in chapter 5, I will examine the genetic overlap of various traits with aggressive behavior.
Chapter 6 will outline a newly developed method to test for distributional differences of rare mutation between aggressive and non-aggressive subjects.
At last I will discuss my findings in details and outline future research directions.

\section{Definition of Aggression}
\label{sec:overview_of_reseach_in_aggression}

One can define human aggression as a behavior intended to cause physical or emotional harm to others~\cite{Anderson2002}.
However, this definition is rather incomplete.
It is also important to consider the unwilling participation of the victim as well.
Hence behaviors in which the target does not intend to avoid the aggressive behavior, such as in sexual masochism~\cite{Berkowitz1993,Baumeister1989,Baron2007,Geen2001} should not be considered an aggressive act.
Thus the motivation of the victim to avoid such harm plays an important role in the definition of aggression.  
Therefore I will use the following working definition:
\begin{mydef}[Aggression]\label{def:aggression}
	`Aggression is the delivery of an aversive stimulus form one person to another, with intent to harm and with an expectations of causing such harm, when the other person is motivated to escape or avoid the stimulus'~\cite{Geen2001}
\end{mydef}

While aggression is most commonly associated with physical harm, Definition~\ref{def:aggression} also includes a broader spectrum.
Non violent behavior, like spreading gossips, damaging a victims property either due to emotional anger or as a planned action to gain an advantage to a higher goal.
This large spectrum of aggression makes it necessary to specify the broader dimension of this behavior.

\subsection{Forms of aggression}
\label{sub:forms_of_aggression}

One can separate aggressive behavior into \textit{affective aggression} and \textit{instrumental aggression}.
While \textit{affective aggression} is characterised as emotional, impulsive, thoughtless and unplanned behavior, \textit{instrumental aggression} is defined as a planed and proactive behavior to obtain a certain higher goal~\cite{Berkowitz1993,Geen2001}.
This distinction has been extended by a number of similar concepts, such as \textit{reactive/proactive} and \textit{offensive/defensive} aggression.
While these terms have slightly different meaning, depending on situation and field of research, the general concept remains similar~\cite{Geen2001, Blanchard2005b}.
In psychology, for example, the term \textit{affective aggression} and \textit{instrumental aggresssion} has been established, but more recently authors have used the terms \textit{reactive} and \textit{proactive} aggression~\cite{Geen2001}.
Thus aggressive action in response to a provocation, such as self-defence and in anger, is \textit{reactive aggression} while planned, un-provoked aggression is called \textit{proactive}.

However, despite the differences in terminology it is important to emphasise the strong negative emotional state of \textit{affective/reactive} aggression.
This state, often described as \textit{anger}, launches and guides affective aggression  and is often caused by some form of provocation~\cite{Geen2001}.
Nevertheless, \citet{Frijda1994} suggested that \textit{affective/reactive aggression} is not necessary impulsive.
In some situations a delayed response between provocation and aggressive response is observed. 
In particular long term grudges, or \textit{hatreds} are preoccupations which go beyond the initial provocation but remain deeply emotional.
Thus I will use the term \textit{impulsive aggression} to refer to impulsive, emotional guided aggressive behavior.

In contrast \textit{Instrumental/proactive aggression} is characterised by the absence of an emotional strong cause to cause harm.
For example, the use of gossip and bad-mouthing of a colleague in order to obtain higher chances of receiving a promotion is done in a planned manner with the aim of a higher goal (receiving the promotion).
However, it is often difficult to distinguish actions into affective and instrumental aggression since both forms are not mutually exclusive.
\citet{Geen2001} gave the example of a mother who uses corporal punishment to modify her child's behavior, while still reacting in anger when observing the undesired child's behavior.
Hence mixing a planned aggressive act towards a higher goal with an emotional, angry state.

Both forms of aggression, affective and instrumental, can be either physical or verbal.
While physical aggression in humans is homologous to other animals, verbal aggression, also called \textit{indirect}, \textit{relational} and \textit{social} aggression, is relatively distinct to humans~\cite{Archer2005}.
These verbal behaviors cause harm to others by gossiping, spreading rumors, or excluding other from social groups.
While the terms \textit{indirect}, \textit{relational}, and \textit{social} aggression have been differently conceptualized in the past~\cite{Archer2001}, they are expressed in common behaviors and can be contrasted to physical, \textit{direct}, aggression.
Hence the terms are more similar than distinct and I will therefore proceed to call all them \textit{indirect} aggression in order to distinguish it more from the physical, more direct aggressive behavior~\cite{Archer2005}.

Research in animals have often used a slightly different terminology.
Investigations often have distinguished between \textit{offensive} and \textit{deffensive} aggression~\cite{Blanchard2005b}.
Similar to \textit{affective} aggression \textit{offensive} attacks arise from a response to a threat to the animals resources, thus are the response to a certain provocation.
These resources could be sexual partners, food, social status, or in the case of humans, also money.
On the other hand, \textit{deffensive} aggression is the result to a direct threat to the subject life, a concept closer related to \textit{instrumental} aggression.
While this distinction might hold in mice and rats, the separation between \textit{offensive} and \textit{deffensive} aggression is more blurred in primates, including humans.
For example, humans are known to hunt lions and other predators.
In contrast to non-predators, these animals are, for the most part, not eaten which would suggest a form of defensive aggressive behavior.
However, within most human cultures killing a large predator is seen to enlarge ones social status by showing strength and courage towards the others.
A behavior which could be described as an \textit{offensive} action.
Thus the distinction between \textit{offensive} and \textit{deffensive} aggression is blurred.
This blurred distinction reflects the above described example of the punishing mother by \citet{Geen2001}.
However, \citet{Blanchard2005b} suggest, while the separation between \textit{offensice/affective} a and \textit{defensive/instrumental} might be blurred in humans, the distinction holds in general.
The authors suggest that rather insufficient analysis and not a disconnection between animal and human behavior are responsible for the blurred distinction within humans.
However, \citet{Blanchard2005b} provide little evidence for their claims and one can argue that the complexity of human society makes a comparison between sub-categories of aggressive behavior across species especially difficult. 
Nevertheless, animal studies have provided valuable insight into aggressive behavior and I will outline a number of experimental findings in animal studies in later sections.

To conclude, one can distinguish between \textit{affective} and \textit{instrumental} forms of human aggression which can be expressed either \textit{direct} or \textit{indirect}.
Research in non-humans have often distinguish between \textit{offensive} and \textit{defensive} forms of aggression.
A distinguish which is more blurred in humans.
I will next consider evolutionary theories in regards to aggression in humans and animals alike.
I will show that aggressive behavior has a strong evolutionary background and that genes which regulate such behavior are under stabilizing selection.

\section{Evolutionary Theories}
\label{sec:evolutionary_theories}

Historically, research of aggression has been divided into nurture versus nature~\cite{Archer2009}. 
Proponents of the nurture side have argued that aggressive behavior is caused by environmental influences, while supports of the nature side of the discussion supported the idea that only differences in the genetic architecture are able to explain individual differences in aggressive behavior.
Today's view is less polarized and acknowledges that both, nature and nurture play a crucial part in aggression.
While not disregarding the environmental aspect of aggression I will mostly focus on the genetic and biological mechanisms of aggressive behavior.
In the following section I will outline evolutionary concepts helpful in explaining and understanding individual differences of aggression. 

Evidence for a long history of human aggression can be found in  palaeontological findings of broken bones, rips and smashed skulls, unexplainable without the consideration of weaponry force.
Occasional findings of weapon fragments in skeletal rib cages suggest that violence and aggression has been part of the human evolutionary history. 
\citet{Buss1997}, one of the founder of evolutionary psychology, suggested that all psychological mechanisms and behavior, including aggression, originate in the evolutionary principle of selection.  
These mechanisms are aimed to solve specific adaptive problems.
Hence some variants of those behaviors and psychological mechanisms might solve certain problems better than others, thus improving overall fitness.
This results in the preservation, replication and spreading of theses variants through a population~\cite{Buss1997}.

\citet{Buss1997} suggested \textit{seven} adaptive problems to which aggressive behavior might be an evolutionary solution.
For example \textit{Co-Opt the Resources of Others}, which can be defined as the use of physical or psychological force to obtain resources hold by another individual or group, can give the aggressors significant advantages in terms of survival and reproduction.
These resources could mean food, water, land or sexual partners.
An example of this can be seen in aggressive behavior of children.
\citet{Campbell1995} noted that aggression among toddlers is often about resources, such as toys, suggesting that this behavioral adaptations is an deeply rooted evolutionary strategy.

Aggression can also be useful in \textit{defending against an attack}.
Since attacking aggressors are a serious threat to valuable resources.
Aggression can be an effective strategy in defending against individuals or groups.
Further, it can be also an adaptive strategy to foster a reputation that would deter potential aggressors~\cite{Buss1997}.
Thus avoiding the potential cost of a physical conflict while defending one's resources.

Another evolutionary benefit of aggression can be found in the social hierarchies in groups.
For example, men who win fights and defeat opponents gain power and status in many societies~\cite{Hill1996}.
The gain in social status can be beneficial in accessing resources and mates~\cite{Archer2009}.
Indeed, hierarchical order in social groups is often established by means of aggressive behavior which enables high ranked individuals priory access to food and patterns~\cite{Lindenfors2011}. 
However, aggression can also result in an decline in status.
\citet{Buss1997} suggested for example that a physical conflict between two professors in a faculty meeting would result in an decline in reputation.
Thus display of aggression is not acceptable in all social situations or helpful in achieving a goal.

In the context of reproduction one should consider aggression towards the same-sex separate of male-female aggression.
Aggression towards same-sex individuals is sometimes aimed to reduce their social status and therefore make them less attractive to the other sex~\cite{Buss1990}.
Hence inflicting damage on a rival directly translates to an increased benefit to the aggressor.
In addition to aggression towards same-sex individuals, aggression is also prevalent towards the opposite sex.
For example, aggression can be used to deter a long-term mate from infidelity~\cite{Daly1982}.
However, also here aggression can have negative consequences in form of retaliation.
A husband might be reluctant to use aggression towards his wive when she is living close to a number of brothers and a powerful father.
Indeed, a study in Madrid, Spain found that women who had a higher density of genetic kin in and around Madrid were less likely to be victim of domestic violence~\cite{Figueredo1995}.
Further, expressing aggression towards another individual sheers energy away from other actives, such as hunting and foraging, and also carries a high risk of injury and death~\cite{Packer1995}.  
This increased cost is also reflected in the conflict resolving method applied across many animals and human.
For example, two competing male red deer may begin their confrontation by roaring repeatedly.
If this does not resolve the conflict both will walk side-by-side while attempting to make them-self look as large as possible.
Only the last stage involves a physical confrontation, potentially causing sever injuries~\cite{Clutton-Brock1979}.
These behaviors, aimed to resolve conflicts without the use of raw force, demonstrates the large costs of physical aggression.
However, it does also show that animals and humans alike are able to avoid those costs by threating the use of physical force.
\citet{Maxson2005} suggested that if the resource holding potential (\acrshort{rhp}), which is defined as the ability to win a physical fight over resources,  as well the resource value (\acrshort{rv}) itself are the same for both contestant, conflicts will usually escalate.

Negative consequences might also be present when aggression is used to gain a higher social status.
In a study~\cite{Packer1995} on 138 female baboons in the Gombe National Park in Tanzania high-ranking females showed lower inter-birth intervals as well as higher offspring survival rates.
Thus one would expect higher life-time reproductive success in baboons with overall higher social rank across their life-time.
However, the authors were not able to associate reproductive success with mean life-time rank.
\citet{Packer1995} suggested that this inconsistency can be explained by considering that higher ranked females are also more likely to suffer  miscarriages.
These stress-related failure in reproduction can be seen as a counter-force to a potential arms-race among female baboons.
Hence the induced aggression by competing for higher social status carries the cost of significant risk of miscarriages.

Therefore, the increase in fitness due to aggressive behavior, either as a direct gain in resources or higher social status, is balanced by large risks such as injuries, death, reduced reproduction and others.
This would indicate that aggression is under stabilizing selection (see figure~\ref{fig:stab}).

\begin{figure}[hp]

  \caption[Stabilizing selection of aggressive behavior]{Stabilizing selection of aggressive behavior (as in~\citet{Anholt2012}).
  The benefit of aggressive behavior is countered by its cost. Thus maintaining a stable level of aggressive behavior within the population}\label{fig:stab}
\end{figure}

Further, same-sex and male-female aggression is not equally balanced among the two sexes and nearly all mammals display sex differences in the expression of aggression.
Qualitative, the type of aggression, as well as quantitative, the amount of aggression.
In general males are more likely to exhibit physical aggression than female.
These sex differences have been discussed in the context of \acrfull{sst}~\cite{Archer2004,Anderson2002,Archer2009}. 
Sexual selection is concerned how a member of one sex choses another individual from the other sex, as well as the competition between members of the sex over access to the other~\cite{Darwin1859}.
In most mammals the more competitive sex is the male~\cite{Archer2009}. 
\citet{Trivers1972} suggested that these sex differences can be explained by the limited parental investment by males in many species.
Parental investment is the amount of resources a parent invests into his or her off spring to increase its survival and reproduction~\cite{Archer2009}.
The theory was first suggested by~\citet{0198504403} and proposes that a male can minimize his parental investment in favor in producing a higher amount of offspring.
In contrast, many female mammals have an large obligatory parental investment, such as gestation and delivery.
This greater parental investment makes it more important of remaining alive in order to raise the offspring.
Hence~\citet{Campbell1999} suggested that this discrepancy resulted in more risk-averse behaviors in female.
This would further predict that while direct aggression is quantitative imbalanced between the sexes, indirect aggression is expressed in both male and female to an equal level due to its lower cost.
Indeed, multiple studies have found no sex differences in indirect aggressive behavior~\cite{NoelCard2008}.
Hence sexual selection can be used to explain sex differences in humans and animals alike.

The above outlined cross-species and evolutionary history of aggressive behavior suggests thats inherited biological factors play a key role.
I have shown that aggression, while having large benefits for the aggressor, also caries significant drawbacks.
In the following section I will outline specific genetic aspects associated with aggression.


\section{Biological Mechanisms}
\label{sec:biological_mechanisms}

As outlined in Section~\ref{sec:evolutionary_theories}, aggressive behavior is present in number of species which indicates that this particular behavior is, form an evolutionary view, relatively old.
However, most findings in regards to the genetics of aggressive behavior comes from animal studies due to the ethical considerations of experimental studies in humans.
Hence previous research has made use of comparative genetics to gain insight into the genetics mechanisms of human aggression.
Comparative genetics is the use and analysis of genomic information across species to identify and relate genes with phenotypes~\cite{Maxson2003}.
A cross species perspectives enables to examine overlapping genes which might affect this particular behavior.
This not only allows to identify genes involved in aggression across species but also enables to consider gene-environment interactions similar in humans and non-humans alike.

\subsection{Investigation approaches}
\label{sub:investigation_approaches}

\citet{Maxson2005} further proposed three general approaches to investigate the genetic architecture of aggressive behavior.
(1) One can identify genes by mapping their sequence to different forms of aggression (see my own study in chapter). %TODO add section reference
(2) Another approach is to alter the genetic code of experimental organisms, such as rats and mice, to test for the effects of different genes on aggression.
(3) Last, one can measure the rate of gene expression within the brain in association with an aggressive phenotype.
Only in recent years option (1) and (3) has been made possible due to progress in the sequencing of human and animal genomes.
Option (2) has the highest scientific validity due to the use of randomized control trials, a method only available in nonhuman animals.
However, one can also add a fourth and fifth category.
Indeed, investigation of DNA methylation in order to uncover the epigenetic mechanisms of aggressive behavior is gaining more traction.
DNA methylation is a biological control mechanisms by cells to control gene expression.
While studies on DNA methylation in human aggression have been only recently been conducted~\cite{VanDongen2015a} this new field of study is potentially promising in investigating the genetic mechanisms of aggression.
Further, while~\citet{Maxson2005} only described molecular methods on can also make use of twin pairs.
Twin studies make use of the genetic similarity (or dissimilarity) of dizygotic and monozygotic twins.
Since diszygotic twins, and siblings for that matter, share 50\% of their genetic markup with their brother or sister, monozygotic twins share 100\%.
This enables to estimate the genetic contribution of aggressive behavior in humans.
These studies have been a popular method to investigate the genetic contribution of a variety of different phenotypes and I will outline a detailed description of this particular method in Section~\ref{sec:twin_based_studies}. 
Most twin studies have estimate the genetic contribution to aggressive behavior between 50\% and 80\%~\cite{Porsch2016}.
While these estimates give a broad understanding about the importance of genetic factors contribution on aggression, twin studies are unable to inform about specific genes or genetic marker.

\subsection{Identification of \textit{MAOA}}
\label{sub:identification_of_MAOA}

One well known genetic characteristic of aggressive behavior was discovered when analysing a rather large Dutch family~\cite{Brunner1993}.
In particular, male members of this family were known for their aggressive behavior, including arson, attempted rape and other forms of aggression.
Genomic analysis revealed that individuals had a deficient monoamine oxidase due to a point mutation in the \textit{MAOA} gene, suggesting a causal link between \textit{MAOA} and aggressive behavior.
Interestingly, this causal link has been replicated multiple times in humans~\cite{Huang2004,Manuck2000} as well in mice~\cite{Cases1995} and monkeys~\cite{Newman2005}.

Within the following section I will outline previous uncovered specific genetic associations in human and nonhuman animals alike.
Further I will discuss previous findings in regards to gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. 

\subsection{Genetic Associations in nonhuman animals}
\label{sub:genetic_associations_in_animals}

Genetic analysis in animals have a number of advantages.
First, one is able to make direct manipulation of the genome in question and second, one is able to quantify aggressive behavior more easily.
For example, aggression in mice can be measured by counting the number of attacks the animal performs when placed in a situation which involves social confrontation with another mouse.

A number of studies have investigated the effect of different neurotransmitter on aggressive behavior, mostly using mice~\cite{Anholt2012}.
For example, studies which focused on serotonin demonstrated differences on the type of receptors activated.
Mice whose \textit{5-HT1B} receptor was knocked out demonstrated hyper-aggressive symptoms while those mice which were treated with \textit{5-HT1A} receptor antagonist displayed reduced aggression~\cite{Saudou1994,Bell1994}.

Further the knock-out of the non-functional nuclear receptor \textit{NR2E1} has been shown to result in a hyper aggressive state in mice~\cite{Young2002}.
Also a knockout of \textit{NOS1} in mice showed an increased level of aggressive behavior.
Interestingly, this particular knockout not only resulted in a hyper-aggressive state but also in an behavior which can described as a relentless attack on opponents who had surrendered or showed no interest in a confrontation.
Hence these mice demonstrated a qualitatively different aggressive behavior compared to other mice knock-outs.
Further, within these animals one could observe clear sex differences.
While male mice showed the above described hyper aggressive state, female mice showed a reduced aggressive behavior against male invaders~\cite{Gammie1999,Nelson1995}.
Hence demonstrating a sex-specific genetic regulator of aggression.

\subsubsection{Gene-Gene Interaction in nonhuman animals}
\label{ssub:Gene-Gene_Interaction_in_nonhuman_animals}

In their review \citet{Anholt2012} pointed to a number of gene-gene interactions which seem to regulate these single gene effects.
For example, the knockout of \textit{NR2E1} had different effects depending on the genetic background~\cite{Young2002}.
While the mouse models C57BL/6J-frc and B6129F1-frc both displayed increased levels of aggression, C57BL/6J-frc demonstrated significantly more aggressive behavior.
Hence suggesting that the knock-out resulted in a different effect depending on the genetic background.
Identification of further gene-gene interactions in humans, however, remains difficult due to the lack of sufficient sample size in many genome-wide association studies.

\subsection{Genetic Associations in Humans}
\label{sub:genetic_associations_in_humans}

Genetic associations studies in humans commonly face difficulties of obtaining large enough sample sizes and therefore lack statistical power.
Thus previous studies have focused on only a handful selected genes to investigate the genetic architecture of human aggression.
For example, Alzheimer patients which are homozygous for the \textit{apolipoprotein E e4} allele have been reported to be more at risk of expressing aggressive behavior~\cite{Craig2004,VanDerFlier2006}.
However, these finding could not be replicated in a study with larger sample size~\cite{Hollingworth2006}.
Similar, studies on the catechol-O-methyl transferase gene (COMT) in schizophrenia have associated a single polymorphism with aggression~\cite{Hirata2013,Calati2011} but the sample size of these studies are limited.
Thus one should view these results with caution.
%TODO there is more!!!!!!

\subsubsection{Gene-Gene interactions in humans}
\label{ssub:Gene-Gene_interactions_in_humans}

Similar to the findings in mice, an single-gene association study of $1,308$ patients with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and criminal offenders demonstrated single polymorphism in \textit{NOS-I} gene associated with impulsively, hyperactivity and aggression.
While this study was able to confirm smaller studies analysing the same gene, the combined sample size is rather small.
Thus one should be caution in respect to \textit{NOS-I} since genome-wide analysis are preferred.

The discovery of the importance of \textit{MAOA} put other neurotransmitter into focus, including serotonin~\cite{Murphy2008}, dopamine, norepinephrine, and GABA~\cite{Marino2005,Miczek2002}.
For example,~\citet{Hohmann2009} identified an association between a \acrfull{vntr} and externalizing behavior in the dopamine D4 receptor (\textit{DRD4}) gene.
Interestingly, subjects which also had a mutation in the serotonin transporter \textit{SLC6A4}, specifically in the serotonin-transporter-linked polymorphic region (\textit{5-HTTLPR}), showed high levels of aggressive behavior.
This behavior was not present if only one of the two mutations were presents.
Hence this is a rare display of a gene-by-gene interaction, also called epistasis~\cite{Anholt2012}, in a behavioral phenotype.

To conclude, genetic analysis in humans has shown multiple different potential genes implicated in human aggression.
Most prominently \textit{MAOA} as well as \textit{DRD4} in combination with \textit{SLC6A4}.
However, studies in humans have so far only focused on a few set of candidate genes due to the high costs associated with an analysis of the whole genome.

\section{Genes and the Environment}
\label{sec:gene_environment_interactions}

Many behavioral phenotypes depend on the surrounding environmental conditions (see figure~\ref{fig:plasticity}).
For example, in threating situation one might be prone to exhibit more aggression compared to non-threatening circumstances. 
On the other hand, gene-environment interactions is when the phenotypical expression of one genotype depends on environmental stimuli (see figure~\ref{fig:gene_env_interaction}).
Interestingly, aggressive behavior is one of the few behavioral phenotypes were previous research has shown gene-environment interactions.

\end{figure}

\subsection{\textit{MAOA} interactions}
\label{sub:maoa_interactions}

The effects of \textit{MAOA} and serotonin transporters have been show to be dependent on the individuals previous experiences.
\citet{Caspi2002} showed in a sample of $499$ male children that some children who were maltreated developed anti-social behavior.
This effect seemed to be moderated by a mutation in \textit{MAOA}.
Children with higher expression of \textit{MAOA} were less likely to suffer from anti-social behavior following maltreatment.
These results were later replicated by a number of similar studies~\cite{KimCohen2006}.
However, not all studies were able to replicate these findings.
\citet{Anholt2012} suggested that the failure to replicate can be explained by the low statistical power of some of the studies as well as diversity of the used samples, including sex, age and ethnicity.
Indeed, other studies have found a more complex picture of \textit{MAOA}-environment interactions.
\citet{Huang2004} for example showed that this gene-environment interaction is male specific, and \citet{Weder2009} demonstrated that extrem cases of maltreatment did not result in varying effects of later anti-social behaviors.
Nevertheless, it is still unclear how maltreatment in childhood results in anti-social behavior later in life and how \textit{MAOA} is moderating this effect.
Further, most studies have little statistical power.
Thus large scale population data is necessary to confirm this gene-by-environment interaction.

\subsection{\textit{5-HTTLPR} interactions}
\label{sub:httlpr_interactions}
Interestingly, also the serotonin transporter has been subject to investigations regarding gene-environment interactions.
However, the results are less conclusive.
Polymorphism in \textit{5-HTTLPR} have been found to result in higher levels of aggressive behaviors in a people with depression~\cite{Gonda2011}, and intellectual disabilities~\cite{May2010} while not demonstrating associations in non-affected subjects.
In the review by~\citet{Anholt2012} the authors suggested these associations as a further indicator for gene-environment interactions.
However, given the low sample size of the studies other possibilities might be possible as well.
For example shared genetic mechanism between depression, intellectual disabilities and aggression could also explain the increased effect of polymorphism in \textit{5-HTTLPR} on aggressive behavior. 
Nevertheless, the identification of gene-environment interaction within aggressive behavior suggest a complicated genetic architecture underlying aggressive behavior.
\bigskip

In conclusion, I have outline definitions of aggressive behavior and evolutionary theories and concepts surrounding it.
Further, I have reviewed and described previous research into specific genetic aspects of aggression in human and nonhuman animals alike.
In addition I have shown that previous research has also demonstrated considerable gene-environment interaction within aggression.
In the following chapter I will describe methods used to investigate the genetic architecture of human aggression.
